## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

-can labels be added from jessica's summarise function in table 1 creation?

-imputed so it wouldnt delete

-missing not at random: not everyone in the never group is missing MNAR in a way that would introduce bias, dont know the cause of

#fit model with interaction term

\*double check viral load

\*\*mainly missing data and outliers

#poorly designed study if you dont address missing data first

#use of last obs

use of multiple imputation

sensitivity analysis on missing data

#if you have implemented a missing data method, rerun the analysis with different assumptions

#what method are good and simple

-if covariate has high rate of missingness, (more than 20%)

-information on datamanagement in introduction

#maybe make a dumy variable with smoke
